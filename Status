I am just now able to read the requirements.md. I am in the hospital with my uncle, and it is touch and go. I will finish this, but I am working with mediocre-at best internet and a borrowed computer. 
I set up the repo, and now I am evaluating, etc.
It is 1:20 my time, and I will now open the requirements. 
I will push all of this once I am finished, so that you can see my timeline and challenges in this env.
However, I would at least like to finish this test as I committed to do, even if it takes too long given the circumstances.
This is a challenge sometimes working remotely, so I will keep pushing forward.
Here we go!
1:21, opening requirements....
Apologies. We were interrupted by the doctor. No change, but I am now starting the requirements.
1:43 just now able to finish requirements and read them three times over.
Will begin test plan creation now. It is 1:44
1:55 - I am being asked to move, as they are shifting things around and bringing in another patient. I am working on the 
     test plan and trying to get it done quickly.
